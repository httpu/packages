# httpu packages

This is where I'll be storing packages to work with the httpu client. To get the
latest packages, using the client you may run:

```
httpu pull
```

and then to load a package, such as the httpbin package:

```
httpu new httpbin
```

It's that simple. You may easily create your own packages, and if you want to
can even contribute them to this repo for others to use.
